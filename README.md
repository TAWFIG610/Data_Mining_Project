# ðŸš€ Predicting Student Performance Using Data Mining Techniques ðŸ“ŠðŸŽ“

Iâ€™m excited to share my recent **data mining project**, where I analyzed and predicted student performance using the **StudentPerformancePrediction dataset** from Kaggle. This study leverages data mining techniques to uncover key factors influencing academic success based on **demographic**, **behavioral**, and **educational** variables.

## **Key Highlights of the Project**:

- **Dataset**: I worked with a dataset of 2,392 high school students, exploring variables like **study time**, **parental support**, and **extracurricular activities**.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The project started with an in-depth exploration of the data to understand its structure, detect outliers, and visualize relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: A robust pipeline was implemented to tackle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling. Handling these crucial steps ensured that the data was prepared for more accurate model predictions.
- **Modeling & Evaluation**: Several classification algorithms were tested, with **Random Forest** emerging as the most accurate, achieving an impressive **96.2%** accuracy. We also tested different train-test splits, discovering that **smaller test sets** led to higher accuracy in our predictions.

## **Challenges & Future Improvements**:
- **Overfitting**: Despite high accuracy, some overfitting was observed, as the model performed well on the training set but less so on unseen data.
- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset showed signs of class imbalance, which could have affected model generalization.
- **External Factors**: The model did not account for **psychological** and **environmental factors** that could influence student performance.

## **Next Steps for Improvement**:
In future iterations, I'll focus on:
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** to enhance model performance.
- **Ensemble Learning** to combine the power of multiple models.
- Incorporating **new student engagement indicators**, such as attendance and participation in school activities, for more robust predictions.

This analysis provides valuable insights that can help **educators** and **policymakers** in crafting better strategies to support **student success**. The data-driven recommendations could be pivotal in enhancing educational outcomes.
